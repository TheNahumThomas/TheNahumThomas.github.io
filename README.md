| ***Social Media***<br><br>I have had and idea for a new social networking platform. It relies somewhat on a counter-culture movement driven by social media fatigue. BeReal had a similar angle and, despite its somewhat short-lived nature, they found great success using a simple concept centred around authenticity and living in the moment. BeReal worked because not only did it have a mechanism driving users to return built into its main USP but it also fed into the other social media giants by having a shareable, branded output that could be plastered all over Instagram or SnapChat. I never used the app but I can't imagine that anybody was looking at these things on the BeReal platform - they were for the people on those social media giants who were implicitly not "being real".<br><br>FOMO is a big psychological driver on the internet. People gamble their life's savings on crypto assets they know nothing about because they missed out on a once in a lifetime opportunity 13 years ago. Posting things you've done online is almost always for the benefit, or detriment, of somebody else. Self-actualisation is supposedly the pinnacle of human existence, we have an innate need to find ourselves and realise our true potential but social media is and always has been a stifling proxy for doing so. Erich Fromm wrote about the sense of identity as a basic human need alongside frames of orientation and how those needs can paradoxically lead an individual to forego their own search for identity in favour of conforming to a common sense of self. This common self, with regards to social media, is inexorably attached to somebody's perceived social status and possessions which are deliberately conflated through the concept of "having" followers or "receiving likes". In this system, a person's "identity" is easily recognised in others and depends on others seeing it in them with a common and fruitless goal of chasing an inauthentic, potential version of themselves.<br><br>This has already begun straining under its own weight and, to paraphrase Karl Marx, has started to produce its own gravediggers. Endlessly ironic counter-cultures that use terminology like "the matrix" or "wokeness" to describe an invisible force or pressure that influences a persons decisions have appeared in droves without realising that they are contributing to, reliant on and at the mercy of systems with far more power than the ones they have invented for an opponent.<br><br>I have ranted enough - I will separate this out and describe my idea. |
